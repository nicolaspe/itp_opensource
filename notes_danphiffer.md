# Licensing on open-source

## as a legal text
protects the author, liabilities, is about rights

- CC0: as public domain as possible
- GPL:
  - Run the software as you wish
  - freedom to copy/redistribute
  - modify source code "so that you control it instead of it controlling you"
  - redistribute your modified changes (GPL derivatives MUST BE GPL)
  - disallows future restrictions!
- MIT: most popular one right now. very permissice on reuse (very compatible with other licenses)
- BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution): 
  - doesn't require the sw to be released

## Enfoceability (USA centered)
GNU GPL license constitutes a contract
